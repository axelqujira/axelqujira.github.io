Qujira means ‘whale’ in Japanese. Why did we name our service after a large aquatic mammal? Because when a whale jumps from the sea it lands back in the water with a huge splash. And that’s what we hope to do for you: help your business make a huge splash.

Whales can also communicate and find each other over vast distances in the blue open ocean. Just like the whale finds its friends, we want to help you find your community in the big blue sea of the digital space.

And finally, the world’s biggest creature, the Blue Whale, eats some of the world’s tiniest creatures. And yet, a lot of small things can let a whale grow pretty big. That’s how we think about business: a lot of small things come together to make your business grow!

Why did we start Qujira?

We have started a few businesses over the years, so we know what it’s like to face a variety of bewildering challenges all at once. We spent a lot of our time learning how to do everything ourselves and now we want to share that expertise with others.

We also believe in being as self-reliant as possible, so we carry that philosophy forward with us in everything we do at Qujira. We don’t want to lock anyone into working with us by obfuscating things or making them proprietary. To that end we use standard systems and customize them to your needs.

As much as is reasonable, we want to give you the tools to run your business. So, we also offer training on how to use everything we set up, be it your website, advertising accounts, and so on. Our aim is to save you all the time and headaches that we had to endure when starting our first businesses.
