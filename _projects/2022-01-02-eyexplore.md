We started EYExplore, a photography workshop service based in Tokyo, in 2016 and had to learn everything from scratch. We spent years honing our services and sharpening our marketing messages to attract the perfect clients for our nicheâ€”and we were quite successful.

To that end we had to learn and master all of the tools that are needed for success in a digital marketplace: Google Adwords, Google Tag Manager, Facebook Advertising, not to mention WordPress and Woocommerce and all of the backend and frontend web development sills that go with building an e-commerce website.

Finally, we started and have grown a successful YouTube channel with educational content that ultimately drives traffic and clients to our core business.
