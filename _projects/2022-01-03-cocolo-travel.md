In 2015 we started an inbound travel agency and travel industry consultancy. Cocolo focuses on sustainable and slow travel that provides a meaningful experience to both the customers and the local providers. One of the major challenges was integrating modern e-commerce and digital business with the old fashioned style that is prevalent in more rural parts of Japan, where the fax machine still reigns supreme.

For Cocolo, we also developed systems that allowed the team to work remotely and asynchronously, taking advantage of tools such as Asana, Zapier, Google Docs, and other automation systems. These were key to ensure smooth operation when connecting e-commerce to the rustic charms of Japan.

In Japanese ‘Cocolo’ means heart. The brand was designed around this notion of getting to the heart of travel in Japan. It was also a strategic decision based on intimate knowledge of Japanese sensibility—the name always made a positive impression on our local partners.
