We have been on contract with Ricoh since late 2020 to create educational and promotional content featuring their popular camera: the Ricoh GR III. For this project we write, plan, shoot, and edit all of the videos with the goal of attracting a particular demographic to this niche product.

The videos have been a great success resulting in positive feedback, viewer engagement, and increased sales. Our efforts have most recently culminated in a long-form video about a photo shoot with a local geisha.

Finally, we started and have grown a successful YouTube channel with educational content that ultimately drives traffic and clients to our core business.
