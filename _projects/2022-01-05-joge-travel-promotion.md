In late 2020 we were hired by the tourism board of Joge, a small town in western Japan. They wanted a set of videos featuring their local craftspeople and businesses with the goal of attracting tourists and customers buying locally produced goods online.

We traveled with a small crew and spent a week capturing the story of the once burgeoning trading town. Here is an article detailing the co-promotion campaign we did for Joge with Peko Peko Box. The main promotional video even helped the town win the Regional Revitalization Award from Hiroshima Prefecture.
