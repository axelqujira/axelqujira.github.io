In late 2020 we were hired by the tourism board of Joge, a small town in western Japan. They wanted a set of videos featuring their local craftspeople and businesses with the goal of attracting tourists and customers buying locally produced goods online.

We traveled with a small crew and spent a week capturing the story of the once burgeoning trading town. [Here is an article](https://jogetenryo.com/news/377/) detailing the co-promotion campaign we did for Joge with Peko Peko Box. The main promotional video even helped the town win the [Regional Revitalization Award](https://www.47news.jp/5373038.html) from Hiroshima Prefecture.
