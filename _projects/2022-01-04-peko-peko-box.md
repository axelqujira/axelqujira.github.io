As the 2020 pandemic hit the travel industry, we worked to develop a new brand called Peko Peko Box. In Japanese ‘pekopeko’ is the sound your stomach makes when you’re hungry. In the beginning the idea was to bring unique foods from all over Japan to people overseas, but the service quickly evolved to also include various useful items and knicknacks as well, eventually turning into a full fledged e-commerce storefront.

As part of the Peko Peko Box formula we also produce a lot of media, including YouTube videos that feature the locations and people that are the source of the goodies in the box and in the store. Each box also ships with a magazine made in house that details the items within.
